  <p style="font-weight: bold">At other concerts I have attended, the soloist never speaks from the stage. Why do you speak to the audience during your concerts?</p>
  <p>Anyone who has attended a concert of mine can attest to my strong belief in tearing down the &ldquo;fourth wall,&rdquo; that imaginary wall that separates the performer from the audience.&nbsp;I believe this wall has contributed to the elitism associated&nbsp;with classical music, separating the sophisticated in-the-know crowd with . . . well, just about everyone else who cannot tell the difference between a legato from a portato.&nbsp;The future of classical music cannot continue on this path but instead must aim to make music relevant and understandable to the new generation of concert-goers.&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s the very reason why I speak to the audience during my concerts, to demonstrate to them that classical music is comprised of the very elements that make us who we are: love, joy, sorrow, temptation, triumph and all the other facets that define the human experience.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Who is your favorite composer?</p>
  <p>This is a difficult question. Who can summarize over three centuries of timeless works of genius and find that one composer who far surpasses all others?&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a daunting task.&nbsp;My favorites have changed through the years.&nbsp;At one moment in my life, I was crazy about Beethoven, and then I had a period where all I wanted to listen to was Bach.&nbsp;But right now,&nbsp;the composer who I feel speaks to me on the deepest level is Debussy.&nbsp;I find myself drawn into the ethereal landscapes painted by the kaleidoscopic sounds of his music.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">How many hours do you practice?</p>
  <p>This is the question I&rsquo;m asked most often.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s always funny when I get this question because as far as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve never actually sat down and counted the number of hours I practice.&nbsp;I simply practice until I am tired or until I finish my goal for the day.&nbsp;There are times in my life where finding time to practice required extra planning and organizing.&nbsp;With the heavy load of AP classes in high school or final exams during college, I learned to use my time wisely and practice efficiently during a limited time.&nbsp;In short, practicing varies every day, but if I had to put a number to it, I would say 4-6 hours.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">When did you know you would become a pianist?</p>
  <p>I never knew a time when I wasn&rsquo;t a pianist.&nbsp;It was very much a profession that chose me.&nbsp;My two older brothers both played piano growing up.&nbsp;Thanks to their daily practicing, I found my perfect secret hiding place as a child: the space underneath the pianos.&nbsp;I loved how the boom of the bass notes made my stomach rumble and how the sounds enveloped me and hid me away from the world.&nbsp;It was instantly captivating and was probably the first step on my musical journey.&nbsp;I was only 3 years old at the time, and my mom had a difficult time finding a teacher who would take a student that young.&nbsp;I eventually started lessons at 4 years old, and as they say, the rest is history&hellip;</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">What do you do when you&rsquo;re not practicing?</p>
  <p>I have two great passions in my life: music and food.&nbsp;Thankfully, they actually go hand in hand.&nbsp;To me, a deliciously composed dish has a lot in common with a beautiful symphony, both displaying the ultimate combination of notes, nuances and textures.&nbsp;I grew up in a family where eating was a high priority and enjoying delicious, high-quality food was the norm at mealtime.&nbsp;While others eat to live, we most definitely live to eat.&nbsp;If you don&rsquo;t find me practicing, I&rsquo;ll most likely be exploring a new restaurant or whipping up a multi-course gourmet meal for friends and family.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Who took the photos on this website?</p>
  <p>My wonderful, brilliant, and devoted husband.&nbsp;He has an uncanny eye for beautiful images.&nbsp;Armed with his camera and HD video recorder, Irvin has never missed a concert or rehearsal and has documented everything. Without him, I wouldn&rsquo;t have all these gorgeous photos which you&rsquo;ll find throughout this website.&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Where can I buy your CD?</p>
  <p>I get asked this question time and time again after a concert.&nbsp;Currently, I&rsquo;m working on recording a CD of the complete music of Claude Debussy. I find his music exhilarating, sensuous, thoughtful and transcendent. I also feel that I have something unique to offer, something that I really haven&rsquo;t heard in any recent recording.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll be posting more details about the recording on this website soon.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Who made this website?</p>
  <p>This website was a product of lengthy email exchanges, late-night conversations, supportive and creative friends, delicious home-cooked food and a search for a missing pet turtle.&nbsp;The project was spearheaded by my great friend, Roger Hu, who is like the little brother I always wish I had.&nbsp;The graphic designer was Natasha Wu and the web designer was Eric Trinh, incredibly gifted artists who were able to encapsulate who I am within the pages of this website, not a small feat.&nbsp;And of course, many thanks to my husband Irvin who was my aesthetic eye during the whole project.&nbsp;</p>
